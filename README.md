## Notes

When I was commiting my changes to my github repository I was not doing git add . beforehand. This meant that my remote github repository did not have all the changes I had made. When I had a strange error me and one of the instructors decided it would be best to go back to my previous commit and did a hard reset to that commit. This unfortunately deleted all my code since the remote github was not being updated since I wasn't adding my files before I committed and pushed them. This was a fantastic learning opportunity on the importance of being careful when using GIT so I don't delete my code. :)
